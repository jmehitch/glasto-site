    <h4>What is this website?</h4>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>A central place for all the info for the glasto groups system.</p>
    <p>I created this site last year when we knew a trick that increased our chances of getting in. This year things are a bit different as See Tickets have started using a new queue system and website setup that stops the trick from working.</p>
    <p>This means the only way we can all improve our chances of getting tickets is by trying in a big group. I explain why below. I've added a section with some info about the new system for this year but I don't really have any idea of how it works, so take all the suggestions with a pinch/shovel of salt.</p>
    <p>At the top of the page is a link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_AkGAl0r5HGUdgwyXUeuQ9tFUx6RE4WBkh66SCZlSfA/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> with everyone's details. Please check that these are all correct as I've had to manually enter them all.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h4>Why bother with all this group shite?</h4>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>The basic idea of trying to get tickets as a massive group is that by having more people it increases everyone's chances of getting tickets.</p>
    <p>Some groups won't get through at all and some groups may get through to the purchasing page more than once, meaning they will be able to buy for themselves and another group(s).</p>
    <p>All groups try for themselves first, once you get tickets for your group everyone continues to try for other groups, we continue this process til we all have tickets or they officially sell out.</p>
    <p>The system works on good faith and only works when everyone groups together as a team, the aim is to get everyone tickets and have a lovely time in a field. Please help everyone out.</p>
    <p>We have a group of ~60 people trying in ~10 groups - in theory, we only have to get through to the booking page 10 times between all of us for us all to get tickets.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h4>How the group system works:</h4>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>Some important notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PLEASE CHECK YOUR DETAILS in the spreadsheet before the sale as I've had to manually enter/copy & paste them all, I take no responsibility for any errors</li>
      <li>DO NOT PUT YOURSELF IN MULTIPLE GROUPS (i.e. you're trying individually in a different group separate to the one you're in on our spreadsheet, PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS) - this will jeopardise the chances of everyone else in your group getting tickets</li>
      <li>If, when you're going through the booking process, you get an error that someone's details are incorrect, continue the booking without them, 5 tickets are better than 0</li>
      <li>When the sale starts, only send absolutely essential messages to the WhatsApp group - see the steps below for what to send. I will keep the spreadsheet up to date with which groups are left to get tickets for and send updates to the group.</li>
      <li>Anyone who used the IP address trick last year will need to remove the line we added from their hosts file - otherwise you won't be able to access the ticket page. Please check you can go to `glastonbury dot seetickets dot com` BEFORE the sale starts.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>When the sale starts, do not put anything other than what's below in the group. I will keep the spreadsheet up to date and send status updates to the group.</p>
    <p>On the day of the sale, make sure you have your laptop/PC(s) and/or phone/tablets etc. ready to go. You want to have at least two devices on different networks (mobile data and WiFi), more will increase your chances but it's a risk (see section below).</p>
    <p>Make sure you have a way of having the tickets WhatsApp group up, the spreadsheet and the ticket page open - before 08:55/17:55.</p>
    <p>Also, make sure you have a debit card with enough money on it to get at least 2 groups through (it's £450 for one group, so total £900) - if you don't have this then let me know before the sale and we can share some card details around so there's no issues when we get to the payment stage. We can sort out transfers and everything afterwards.</p>
    <p>It will be chaos on the day so remember to update the group with your status so everyone knows what's going on.</p>
    <p>These are the steps to follow on the day of the sale:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>At ~08:50-08:55 (or ~17:55 for Bus sale), go to to the ticket sale page on all devices you're trying with (not linking it here in case they have some weird bot check for redirects: `glastonbury dot seetickets dot com`)</li>
      <li>At 09:00 (or 18:00), you should automatically get assigned a place in the queue</li>
      <li>Wait until you're at the front of the queue and are redirected to the booking page</li>
      <li>When you get to the booking page, send a message to the tickets WhatsApp group saying: "GROUP _NAME_ IN", e.g. "GROUP ROBERTS IN"</li>
      <li>Fill in all the details for the group (copy and paste from the spreadsheet or the group page on this site)</li>
      <li>Pay for the booking and complete the purchase</li>
      <li>When you see the booking confirmation send a message to the group saying: "GROUP _NAME_ PAID" e.g. "GROUP ROBERTS PAID"</li>
      <li>Go back to step 1 and repeat (or wait until your other devices/people in your group get in), do this until all groups have tickets</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>The new queue system:</h4>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>There is a new system in place for the ticket sale this year. The old IP address trick won't work, there will be no refreshing tricks and using loads of tabs will increase your chances of getting blocked.</p>
    <p>It looks like See Tickets are using Queue-it with Akamai CDN for the queue system to randomly assign everyone to a queue at time of sale. See the <a href="https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/info/#tickets--glastonbury-ticket-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glasto ticket info page</a> for more details.</p>
    <p>In theory, the way this will work is that everyone who logs on to the ticket site before 9AM (or 6PM) will be put in a pre-queue waiting room. As the clock ticks over the start time, everyone in the waiting room will be randomly assigned a place in the queue. You then wait in line til you get to the front. When you get to the front you'll be redirected to the booking page. Apparently, you then have 10 mins to buy tickets (unless the sell out in this time).</p>
    <p>The more devices you have in the waiting room, the more spaces you will be assigned in the queue (i.e. the more tickets you have in the lottery). HOWEVER, if you have too many devices on the same network/IP address then you increase your chances of getting blocked, as it says on the ticket page above.</p>
    <p>If you have multiple devices to try on, or multiple people trying in the same household, try and spread them across different networks (mobile data and WiFi). Using VPNs may or may not get you blocked, they will certainly increase your chances of getting blocked.</p>
    <p>I've done a bit of reading on how See Tickets/Queue-it will police/monitor for bots and how you could get blocked (for too many devices on the same network, too many tabs on the same device etc). The basic answer is that it's complicated and almost impossible to know.</p>
    <p>When you connect to the ticket site your session/connection will be assessed by Queue-it/Akamai and be assigned a bot score. There are many factors (IP address, browser type, extensions, mouse tracking behaviour, etc) that will affect your score. If you get a score above whatever threshold they've set then you'll be blocked from the site.</p>
    <p>You'll probably be fine with a few devices on the same network/WiFi connection, but not too many (how many is too many? I don't know). You will almost definitely only want one tab per device.</p>
    <p>The queue system will be similar to Ticketmaster for Oasis, for those who tried.</p>
    <p>My advice for most people would probably be just to use a laptop on your home WiFi and your phone on mobile data.</p>
    <p>If you have access to a more networks then you could use another device on a different network (e.g. work VPN). I'm going to try a couple of devices per network but accepting the risk of getting blocked.</p>
